# End of service
Hello everyone, Youtube Dislike Viewer will shut down on 31/04/2022 forever, it has been a nice journey and a great learning experience for me, I recommend all of you to download the "Return Youtube Dislike" extension!

(Extension will keep working for the time being using Return Youtube Dislike's API)

Love ♥️
